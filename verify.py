"""evidence-record-conformance verifier — stdlib-only, no dependencies, no network.

Usage:  python3 verify.py            # runs every vector in MANIFEST.json
Exit 0 only if: every vector produces its expected verdict AND the run observed both
verdicts (valid + reject) AND every reject reason code in the manifest was exercised.
A green run therefore demonstrates the verifier *discriminates*, not merely accepts.

Layer under test: the EVIDENCE RECORD — the layer whose properties must survive the
record being held by an interested party. Checks implemented, each with at least one
adversarial vector for its known failure class:

  digest_recompute      canonical form -> keccak256 content address
  canonical_bytes       claimed canonical bytes actually canonical (RFC 8785 key order,
                        incl. the integer-key ordering class that breaks naive impls,
                        and the supplementary-plane class where UTF-16 code-unit order
                        diverges from code-point order)
  chain_link            link digest binds artifact + prev + sequence number
  chain_set             per-seller continuity AND completeness (no silent omission),
                        incl. per-record link recomputation where links are presented
  anchor_relation       anchoredDigest = SHA-256(subjectDigest bytes) — the existence bound
  phase_claim           a record of one economic phase must not verify as a later phase
  independence_claim    a record attested only by parties to the transaction MUST NOT
                        count as an independent/neutral finding
  offer_binding         a receipt that does not commit to the accepted offer's canonical
                        digest MUST NOT be evaluated as proof that a specific offer's
                        terms were paid (the offer-substitution class)
  decision_evidence_binding
                        a protected record presented as evidence of an authority decision
                        must commit to the exact canonical decision-evidence object; an
                        unbound or substituted requested-to-effective reduction rejects
  boundary_binding      a boundary event that changes a stream's verification parameters
                        must bind the prefix it extends AND its own position in that
                        prefix's continuation — naming the prefix alone is satisfiable by
                        two conflicting continuations at once; and coverage claimed over
                        an empty attested prefix is a downgrade, not a pass

SCOPE BOUNDARY (stated, not implied): this stdlib core decides the STRUCTURAL predicate —
digests, canonical bytes, sequence closure, link arithmetic, declared-claim evaluation.
It does not recover counter-signatures. A structurally complete set whose head and links
were all recomputed by a single forging party passes the structural predicate; what
prevents that in production is that every link is counter-signed at transaction time by
a party outside the transaction and the head is anchored. Signature recovery over the
links (secp256k1 personal_sign; signer published at https://tersign.ai/v1/ledger) is the
crypto profile, deliberately outside this stdlib core — the digests, chain, completeness,
existence and criteria checks above require no cryptography beyond hashing.
